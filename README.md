# MERN-Learning

Welcome to the **MERN-Learning** repository! This repository contains a collection of individual projects that I have built while learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

Here, I will showcase the different projects and applications I have created, demonstrating the power and versatility of the MERN stack. Each project will be stored in its own folder for easy access and understanding.

## Technologies Used

The projects in this repository primarily utilize the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing data.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js used to build the backend.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend of the application.

Additionally, some projects may include other tools and technologies such as:

- **HTML/CSS**: For creating and styling web pages.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For writing JavaScript code.
- **Redux**: For state management in React apps.
- **Axios/Fetch**: For making HTTP requests from the client-side.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For authentication and authorization.

## Projects

Each project in this repository will have its own folder with a brief description of the project, instructions for setup, and any additional dependencies used.

### How to Navigate the Repository

- **Each project will have its own folder**: Each folder will be named according to the project name or purpose (e.g., `todo-app`, `blog-site`, etc.).
- **README files in each project**: Each project folder will contain a separate README file that provides specific details about the project, setup instructions, and any additional information required to run the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects in this repository, follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prem16-pro/MERN-Learning.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project-folder
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** for both the frontend and backend:
   - For the backend (Node/Express):
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - For the frontend (React):
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   - For the backend (Node/Express):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - For the frontend (React):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

5. **View the application**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port) to view the running project.
